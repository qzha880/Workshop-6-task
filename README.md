# Workshop 6 task
workshop 6 task

- I forked https://github.com/Garuinja/workshop-task-4 for my workshop 6 task.
- I found that the help button in the webpage is interesting, and I want to further develop on it.


## Changes made and experiments during coding
- I removed the sliders for changing the background colour.

- Added a button for writing poems.
  
- Because, in the original sketch, the words will be written on the canvas without pressing the button. I want the sentence to be written down after the button was pressed. (when the user wants to write it down)

- Used RiTa.phones() to change the sentences that the help button will write.
- * (Reference: https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/phones/index.html)
  * (returns to a string containing all Penn phonemes for the input text)
  * Harder to read - "Brain not working"
  * To make the sentences not too hard to understand, I also keeped the old sentences.

- Experimented with different RiTa functions.

  * (Reference: https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/tokens/index.html)
  * (Reference: https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/untokenize/index.html)
  * Idea from https://github.com/ellap4n/workshop-task-6 (how to apply multiple RiTa functions at the same time)

- I changed some coding to make the sentences wrote individually, instead of change everything at once.

- Tried to make two buttons with different functions - but the text appear in both areas.

At last, I changed the canvas colour, text colour and added some instructions.
